# MCMC

This repo contains the gif and PNG files to illustrate the Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques to estimate the mass of the Galaxy cluster.

The mcmc_animation.gif file includes the 2D plot for mass and its concerning concentration animated to visualize how the chain works to find the highest peak and the most probable distribution in our parameter space. (Note that this is for fitted_gaussian_data and not the real data)


The mcmc_animation_real.gif file also includes the 2D plot for mass and its concerning concentration animated to visualize how the chain works to find the highest peak and the most probable distribution in our parameter space(For the real data)
